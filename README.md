Prevents automatic image resizing after uploading in WordPress.

## Description
Tired of having your large, high-quality images automatically resized into smaller, lower-quality versions after uploading them in WordPress? This simple plugin prevents WordPress from resizing your images during upload, allowing you to upload images at their original size and quality.

With this plugin activated, images added through the media uploader will no longer be resized or have multiple resized versions created. Your original uploaded image files will be left intact at their original dimensions and file size. No more fuzzy, pixelated images!

By preventing automatic resizing, this plugin helps you:

1. Maintain maximum image quality and resolution
2. Avoid distorted or blurry images from excessive resizing
3. Save storage space on your server by eliminating unnecessary extra image sizes
4. Take full control over image sizing and optimization

Simply install and activate this plugin, and your image uploads will be free of any automatic resizing or compression. You can then use your favorite image editor or resizing tools to create perfectly sized image derivatives manually. Regain creative control over your images!

## Installation
Install and activate the plugin.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q:** Will this plugin break my existing website images?  
**A:** No, this plugin only affects new image uploads going forward. Any images you've already uploaded and that WordPress has resized will remain unchanged. Only newly uploaded images will avoid resizing.

**Q:** What happens if I deactivate this plugin later on?  
**A:** If you deactivate this plugin, WordPress will go back to resizing images on upload automatically per its default settings. Any full-size original images uploaded while the plugin was active will remain intact as uploaded.

**Q:** Does this work with galleries, sliders, and other media uploads?  
**A:** Yes, this plugin will prevent resizing on any images uploaded via the WordPress media uploader in pages, posts, galleries, sliders, widgets, or any other location. As long as the images are added through the media uploader tool, resizing will be disabled.
